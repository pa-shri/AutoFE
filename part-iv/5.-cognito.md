# 5. Cognito

Cognito is an automated feature engineering framework for supervised learning. It explores various feature construction choices in a hierarchical and non-exhaustive manner, ehile progressively maximizing the accuracy of the mode through a greedy exploraion strategy.

**Transformation Tree:**

Cognito uses the notion of a hierarchical transformation tree where the root represents a given dataset, each node transformed dataset and edges represent transforms. Each node\(dataset\) is associated with an accuracy score that is measured as the performance of a predictive model built using the dataset. Thereby, the problem of feature construction is reduced to finding the node with maximum accuracy.

As shown in figure, in a transformation tree, a node corresponds to a dataset \(root is the input dataset, rest are transformed\) and an edge to a transform. In the given example, feature engineering is performed for a regression dataset using four transforms and results in an increases in accuracy from 0.392 to 0.522.

To explore the tree one of the following strategies are used:                                                                     

* **Depth first traversal**
* **Global traversal**
* **Balanced traversal**

**Depth first traversal:** Starting off with a random transformation at the root and exploring a branch until an improvement in accuracy for 'gamma' consecutive nodes is obtained. If so, the node is marked as 'done' and the highest accuracy node among the remaining active nodes explored thus far is chosen to continue the exploration is a similar manner and so on. The ties\(if any\)

**Global traversal:** promotes global search for the most promising child of any node explored so far. The promise of a future node is evaluated through a relative measure of how successful the edge transform leading up to it has performed so far in the tree.

**Balanced traversal:** It is always based on a time or node budget where a strategy is chosen at each step until the budget is 'exhausted-explored\(global options\)' or 'exploit\(work on depth\)' using a biased random selection strategy varying between exploration at the beginning and exploitation towards the end of the search

**Feature selection:** 

Cognito provides the option to perform feature selection at each node on the newly generated features post the transformation application. This pruning ensures the manageable size of the dataset throughout the tree and speeds up the execution. The drawback of this approach is the premature discarding of features on which additional transformations might have yielded useful features**.**
