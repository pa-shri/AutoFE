# Candidate Feature Evaluation and Selection:

To evaluate the performance of the Classifier on the joint feature set Fi ∪ {fi,j }. The evaluation is conducted using k-fold cross-validation. 

The evaluation continues until either:

E\(F ∪ {fcand}\) + ε ≤ E\(F \), where E measures the error, and εw is a predefined parameter or the number of evaluated candidate features exceeded a predefined parameter. In this case, the highest performing member of RankedFcand is chosen, given that it exceeds the minimum threshold.
