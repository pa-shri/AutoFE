# 1. FeatureTools

Featuretools is a framework to perform automated feature engineering. It is also the first python open-source library to create features from a set of relational tables. It excels at **transforming temporal and relational datasets** into matrices for Machine Learning.

FeatureTools is based on a method known as ‘**Deep Feature Synthesis**’ \(The name Deep Feature Synthesis comes from the algorithm’s ability to stack primitives to generate more complex features. Each time we stack a primitive we increase the “depth” of a feature!\).
