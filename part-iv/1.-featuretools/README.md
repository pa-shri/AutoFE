# 1. FeatureTools

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2817%29.png)



Featuretools is a framework to automatically generate features. It is also the first python open-source library to create features from a set of relational tables. It excels at **transforming temporal and relational datasets** into matrices for Machine Learning.

FeatureTools is based on a method known as ‘[**Deep Feature Synthesis**](deep-feature-synthesis-dfs.md)’ \(The name Deep Feature Synthesis comes from the algorithm’s ability to stack primitives to generate more complex features. Each time we stack a primitive, we increase the “depth” of a feature!\).
