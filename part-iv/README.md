# Part IV - Automated Feature Engineering

Automation, a technique of making a process or a system work independently without human intervention. Any process that is repetitive day in and day out must be automated to save time and manual effort.

The most important part of the Machine Learning pipeline, **Feature engineering** is often described as a tedious, time-consuming, error-prone, and requiring domain knowledge. A lot of research is being done to automate feature engineering workflow to ease the data scientist’s job and allow her to supplement domain knowledge.

> **“AutoFE is the process of generating new features and selecting the best subset of features using a framework that is efficient, time saving, problem independent and iterative compared to manual FE”**

### Advantages of AutoFE: <a id="c015"></a>

* allows data scientists to focus more on other steps of the ML pipeline and iterate through multiple pipelines more efficiently
* obviate the necessity of human intuition and domain-specific knowledge to obtain useful or relevant features
* non-experts can not only extract value from their data quickly but could also build a machine learning model that performs comparable to or even better than models built by the experts

### AutoFE tools: <a id="d0ad"></a>

Below is a list of AutoFE tools for relational as well as non-relational data. Some of these tools perform only feature generation and others perform both feature generation and feature subset selection.

1. FeatureTools
2. AutoFeat
3. TsFresh
4. Cognito
5. OneBM
6. ExploreKit
7. PyFeat
8. AutoLearn
