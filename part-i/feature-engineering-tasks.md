# Feature Engineering tasks:

For a long time, feature engineering was considered as 'Feature Construction'. Though that is not completely wrong, it is one of the many tasks performed as part of feature engineering process. Some of these commonly performed tasks are mentioned below:

  
**1. Feature transformation:** Feature transformation is all about constructing new features from the existing ones. It is often achieved by using mathematical mappings.

**2. Feature generation:** Feature generation or feature extraction is about generating new features that are not the result of the feature transformation process. For example, assuming that one does not view a pixel in an image as a feature, one generates new features for images. Moreover, it makes sense to say that features defined from patterns are generated features. Many domain-specific ways for defining features also belong in the feature generation category.

In many real cases, feature transformation and feature generation/extraction have same basic significance.

 **\(3\)  Feature selection:** Feature generation is about selecting a small set of features from a very large pool of features. The reduced feature set size makes it computationally feasible to use certain algorithms. Feature selection may also lead to improved quality of the result of those algorithms.
