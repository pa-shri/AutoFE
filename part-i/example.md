# Example

Consider if you’re any ride-hailing service say 'Uber' and you want to provide your drivers with the best chance of making more money. You may want to look at your ride data, and _predict_ trips occurring in a city on the weekday vs. the weekend, so your drivers know where to be without having to guess and burn money on gas.

By giving this information to the drivers they are happier because they make more money, and in turn so does Uber. However, to do this correctly, more and more features within the data are needed to give an accurate answer:

* The area or neighborhood of the city
* The types of vehicles used in those areas
* The day, month, hour, and minute, of each type of vehicle in each area over weekend and weekdays.

You can see how this starts to get complicated quickly, as the number of features you want to calculate from a simple question \(**where are trips occurring?**\) starts to grow exponentially.

It can be a long arduous process creating all these features from scratch. It’s not a magic bullet, as you need to put in some thought into what features to be generated. However, if done correctly, you’ll come out with more accuracy for your project.
