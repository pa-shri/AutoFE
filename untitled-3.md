**Search Strategies:**

Once an evaluation method for the variable subsets has been defined, one can start the search for the best subset. A search strategy defines the order in which the variable subsets are evaluated.

Optimal search:

**Exhaustive search**

**Branch and bound**

Sequential search:

**Sequential backward selection**

**Sequential forward selection**

**Beam search**

**Floating search**

Stochastic search:

**Simulated Annealing**

**Genetic algorithm**

**Embedded methods:**

**Forward selection:**

 **Forward selection with least squares**

**Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization**

**Decision tree**

**Backward elimination:**

 **Weight based analysis\(RFE\)**

**LASSO**

**Ensemble methods:**
