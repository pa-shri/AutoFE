# Other transformations

### **Signals Enhancement:**

This involves improving the **signal-to-noise ratio** by applying signal or image-processing filters. These operations include baseline background removal, de-noising, smoothing, or sharpening. The Fourier transform and wavelet transform are popular methods for this purpose.

### **Syntactical feature constructions:**

### **Log transforms:**

Expanding the feature set may seem relevant but it comes at a price of increased dimensionality, irrelevant, noisy or redundant features. But how to identify which features are informative or relevant? 

This is where 'Feature selection' comes in the picture and is the focus of [Part III](../part-iii/) of this book.
