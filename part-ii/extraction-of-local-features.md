# Extraction of local features

For sequential, spatial or other unstructured data, specific techniques like convolution methods using handcrafted kernels or syntactical and structural methods are used. These techniques encode problem-specific knowledge into the features. They can bring significant improvement. They are beyond the scope of this book but it is worth mentioning that they can bring significant improvement.
