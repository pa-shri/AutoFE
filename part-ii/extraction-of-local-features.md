# Extraction of local features:

For sequential, spatial or other unstructured data, specific techniques like convolution methods using hand crafted kernels or syntactical and structural methods are used. These techniques encode problem specific knowledge into the features . They can bring significant improvement\(can be discussed in detail in appendix\)
